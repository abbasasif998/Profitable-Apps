# Project on Profitable App Profiles for the Apple Store and Google Play Markets.
## Aim
Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. We're hypothetically working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and our job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.
